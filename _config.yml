title: SHIVASHISH UPADHYAY
description: I’m Shivashish Upadhyay, a passionate and dedicated Computer Science student at Saginaw Valley State University with a strong focus on software development and machine learning. As a Lab Assistant and Tutor, I’ve had the opportunity to mentor students in courses like Java and Visual Basic.net, which has helped me solidify my technical knowledge while enhancing my communication and leadership skills.
With hands-on experience in Java, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, as well as tools like PyCharm, IntelliJ, and SQL Workbench, I’ve successfully developed several impactful projects. I created an end-of-report summary generator for grocery stores, designed a student data management system, and built my own portfolio webpage using Git version control. These projects have allowed me to take ownership of my work, from ideation to execution, giving me real-world experience in solving complex problems.
I’ve led AI workshops for fellow students and have been recognized with several awards, including "Best Tutor of the Month" and the SVSU Red and White Scholarship. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy using my skills to drive innovation and create scalable solutions.
I’m actively seeking internship or co-op opportunities where I can contribute my skills in full stack development and machine learning, while continuing to grow as a professional. I’m eager to apply my academic knowledge to real-world challenges and be part of a team that’s working on cutting-edge technology.
